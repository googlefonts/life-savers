Do you remember the "Life Savers" candies adds from the 50s? That was a time when Ad Agencies actually hired Lettering Artist for they advertising text. Before the advent of Photo Typesetting, all the text was beautifully drawn by hand.

We are going to put some love to work and bring back the Life Savers hand-lettered Typewriter/Stymie mix. Probably drawn originally by Frazier Purdy for the Sam Marsh Studio.

Updated June 2019 to v3.001. The Bold weight was drawn in 2012 and added in December, and the ExtraBold weight was drawn in August 2013, and finally added to Google Fonts in June 2019 with minor technical adjustments.
